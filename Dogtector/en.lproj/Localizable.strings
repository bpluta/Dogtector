"FAQBestResultsQuestion" = "What can I do to get the best results?";
"FAQBestResultsAnswer" = "To get the most accurate results, the image should be sharp, motionless and should expose the most distinctive parts of a¬†dog such as head and torso. Ideally, the dog should take at least 1/4¬†of¬†image size and should not go beyond its boundaries.";

"FAQSlowDetectionAnswer" = "In some scenarios, live detection may work slower than expected. For instance, it may happen when your device has low power mode enabled or when it is overheated. However some devices are not capable of performing live detection fast enough due to hardware limitations. The feature works best with devices loaded with Apple Neural Engine chip which accelerates processing of neural networks (iPhone XS and newer).";
